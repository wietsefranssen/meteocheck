I want Selection Events like stated in https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/cell-selection-api-reference/. But this is not fully implemented in dash_ag_grid. Thats why you need the api method explained in https://community.plotly.com/t/how-to-use-the-ag-grid-api-with-dash/82582. to handle the feedback.
I dont want sudden browserupdates.
